## A Failure

I would love to say that I completed all the tasks, but that would be a lie. My mental health has been struggling lately, and I had to go a full week without access to my ADHD medication, and ultimately I just was not able to manage my time well enough in the midst of all that. Here is what I *did* do:


### Synthesizer
I attempted the Wavetable synth. I truly believe I was getting close, but I ran into a few roadblocks that I just couldn't figure out. I tried to make a way to have the waves for the table defined in the score file, and it almost worked, but in the last step I couldn't figure out how to convert a string to an LCPTSTR without it getting entirely messed up.

I also included a menu option to manually upload wav files for the table one at a time. For whatever reason, when doing this, the generator stumbles and fails upon attempting to open the wav file, and I have no idea why.

### Effects
I was so focused in on the synth, I didn't even realize I had forgotten to do the effects until it was too late. Unfortunate.

## Conclusion
I hope I at least get some points for trying!
